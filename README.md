# IoT_Security_System

The project aimed to develop a secure IoT system for collecting and
storing data from IoT devices. The system was able to measure temperature,
humidity and detect fire, and provided a user interface for controlling the heating
system and activating the fire alarm. The system used various security measures,
such as authentication, authorization, and encryption, to ensure the privacy and
security of the data being transmitted to the cloud. The data was stored in a
database hosted on Amazon Web Services. The sending data to AWS is done by
using secure MQTT protocol with SSL/TLS encryption.
The results of this project demonstrate the feasibility of creating a secure IoT
system, highlighting the importance of implementing robust security measures in
IoT devices. This project serves as a model for future IoT security solutions and
provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities in this field. The
project demonstrates the potential for further research in the area of IoT security,
to continue improving the security and reliability of IoT systems.
