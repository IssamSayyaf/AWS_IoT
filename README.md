# IoT_Security_System

The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly expanding, and with an estimated 10 billion connected devices by the end of 2022, IoT security has become a crucial concern. A security breach in any one of these devices can potentially compromise the entire network, putting our privacy and data at risk. That's why it's essential to build secure IoT systems to protect our homes and personal information.

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive IoT security system that incorporates both sensing and actuation capabilities.

# Sensing Part
The sensing part of the system measures temperature, humidity and is capable of detecting fire. With these capabilities, the system can provide real-time monitoring and alert the user in case of any emergency.

# Actuation Part
The actuation part of the system allows the user to control the heating system and includes an alarm to alert in case of a fire. The system also gives the user complete control over the heating system, enabling them to adjust the temperature as per their convenience.

# Data Management
The system sends data to the cloud periodically, where it is processed and stored in a secure database. The data management system uses various security measures, including authentication, authorization, and encryption, to ensure the privacy and security of the data.

# In Donclusion 
This project provides a complete and secure solution for IoT systems, by incorporating sensing, actuation, and data management capabilities. With its advanced security features, it offers peace of mind and protects the user's privacy and information.
